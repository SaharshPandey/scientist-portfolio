           <p> Though, I am involved in many research elds of astronomy and astrophysics but in the following
            sub-sections, I have mention only some of front-line research areas where I am participating actively
            :</p>
            <br>
            <h3> Fast Photometric Variability in Chemically Peculiar Stars</h3>
            <p >
            We have been conducting an Indo-South African bilateral project The Nainital-Cape Survey" since
            1999 between ARIES Nainital and South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO), South Africa.
            In last fteen years, more than 300 sample stars were examined for the pulsations, making it one of
            the longest ground-based surveys for pulsation in CP stars in terms of time span and sample size.
            The main aim of this survey is to nd new pulsating Ap and Am stars in Northern and Southern
            hemispheres and set-up test bed to perform the asteroseismic study. Under this project, we discov-
            ered rapid oscillation (also known as rapidly oscillating Ap star) in an Ap star HD12098 and  Scuti
            type pulsation in seven Am stars namely HD13038, HD13079, HD25515 HD98851, HD102480,
            HD113878 and HD118660. The more detail information on the Indo-South African project can be
            access through the URL http://www.aries.res.in/cns/
            This survey programme has been nancially supported by DST Govt. of India and NRF, South
            Africa.</p>
            <h3>High-Resolution Spectroscopy and Spectro-Polarimetry of Pulsating CP stars</h3>
            <p>
            For the detailed spectroscopic study of CP stars, in year 2008 we initiated an observing programme
            in the collaboration of the Russian astronomers. To achieve our goals, the high-resolution spec-
            troscopic observations of the sample Ap and Am stars discovered under the The Nainital-Cape
            Survey" were carried out from 6.0-m Russian telescope of Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO),
            Russia. Such observations are very useful to study the pulsation phase of individual spectral lines
            and their locations in the chemically stratied atmosphere. The radial velocity (RV) measurements
            of individual spectral line in peculiar stars enable us to measure the pulsational phase and amplitude
            of the stellar oscillations as a function of the atmospheric height. The time resolved radial velocity
            observations were also used to conrm the variability detected through the photometric observations.
            The combined photometric and spectroscopic analysis of these stars have been used in estimating
            the basic physical parameters such as eective temperature, surface gravity, magnetic eld strength
            and presence of chemical elements in their atmosphere.
            This project was initiated in the collaboration of astronomers from Russia and was supported by
            DST Govt. of India and Russian Academy of Science (RAS), Russia under the ILTP and RFBR
            programs.</p>
            
            <h3>Census of the Variable Stars in Open and Intermediate Age Star Clusters</h3>
            <p>
            Open star clusters are excellent tracers to understand astrophysical problems concerning to star
            formation and stellar evolution. In order to investigate the occurrence of pulsation in A- and F-
            type stars in different galactic environments, we took an initiative in year 2008 to search for the
            photometric variability in a well dened set of young and intermediate age open star clusters. We
            selected sample of 25 open star clusters of different age, metallicity and galacto-centric position
            where probabilities of nding A-type pulsators are relatively high. For an example, using ground
            based time-series photometric observations of an open star cluster NGC6866, we discovered 28 new
            variables stars. Our photometric observations were also used for the estimation of the basic physical
            parameters and kinematic study of the clusters under study. The photometric analysis of the other
            clusters are in progress and we are expecting more interesting results from the data we have collected
            2
            using the observing facilities of ARIES.
            This project is being carried out in the collaboration of astronomers from India, Russia and South
            Africa.</p>
            
            <h3>Study of Pulsational Variability and Rotational Activities using Kepler Data</h3>
            <p>
            We have been also studying the open star clusters and eld stars using combined space and ground
            based time-series photometric data obtained on various facilities at dierent epochs.</p>
            <h2>Open Star Clusters</h2><br>
            <p>After the launch of the Kepler mission on 07 March 2009, enormous of the data have been downloaded
            at the NASA MAST science center. Though the primary objective of Kepler mission was to nd the
            earth like planets in habitable zones in Cygnus and Lyra regions but this mission has also observed
            thousands of stars to probe the interior of the stars and study the stellar evolution using asteroseismic
            technique. Coincidentally one of the cluster NGC6866 observed extensively using 1.04-m telescope
            of ARIES also falls on the Kepler eld. Using the time-series data extracted from the Kepler archive
            data base, we discovered 31  Scuti, 8 
             Doradus, 23 red giants with solar-like oscillations, 4 eclipsing
            binaries and 106 stars showing rotational modulation indicative of star-spots. The combined space
            and ground based data were also used to disentangle the cluster members to the non-members for
            estimation of age, reddening in the direction of cluster, distance and other parameters used to study
            the morphology of the cluster.</p><br>

            <h2>Orbital solutions for new spectroscopic systems in Kepler database</h2><br>
            <p>This project intend to perform high-resolution spectroscopy for a selection of AF-type candidate
            hybrid variable stars detected by the Kepler mission. The proposal's objectives are: 1) to complete
            the phase coverage of the orbits by monitoring the long-term behavior in radial velocity (RV) of
            the new systems and 2) to determine accurate stellar atmospheric properties and v sini for each of
            the components. Here, we propose to extend the time base of the spectroscopic data for 13 new
            and suspected long-period SB1/2/3 systems recently observed with the Hermes spectrograph. The
            immediate goal of the HCT observations is to analyse and model the composite spectra in order to
            derive reliable orbital periods and solutions, as well as to improve upon the component properties of
            these systems.
            This project is being carried out in the collaboration of astronomers from India and Belgium under
            the Belgo-India Network on Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p><br>
            <h2>Field stars</h2><br>
            <p>We have studied the time-series photometric analysis of about 15000 eld stars observed by the
            Kepler space mission. We measured rotation periods of 2270 active stars as a function of spectral
            type and studied the distribution of their amplitudes. We examined the period-color relationship
            for rotational variables and found that this relationship holds for early-F to early A-type stars. In-
            terestingly, we found that this relation is not consistent with the period-age-mass (PtM) relation
            that was previously anticipated. Through the visual inspection of the light curves and periodograms,
            we conrmed the solar-like oscillations in 16 red giant stars and identied 75 additional solar-like
            oscillations. The basic parameters such as masses, radii and luminosities of these solar-like oscilla-
            tors are estimated using the asteroseismic scaling relation. We have characterized several non-radial
            pulsating variables as  Sct, 
             Dor and hybrid stars. The relationship between two newly constructed
            observable, energy" and efficiency" for these stars have also been reported. Our results support
            that the present observational instability strip should be extended towards the red end of instability
            strip to accommodate the  Sct and 
             Dor variables.

            South Africa.</p><br>
            <h2> Low-resolution Spectroscopy of the Kepler Stars</h2><br>

            <p>For the detailed study of a star one need to estimate the basic parameters such as eective tem-
            perature, gravity because these parameters acts as an input for the stellar models. We used the
            low-resolution spectroscopic observations of the Kepler stars from 6.0-m telescope at SAO, Russia,
            2.0-m telescope of HCT India and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope
            (LAMOST) at China. All the spectra were analysed using ULySS (University of Lyon spectroscopic
            software) as well as standardized routines in IRAF package. On comparison of two data sets analysed
            using two dierent techniques, we found that the low-resolution spectroscopic data can be also used
            to estimated the basic parameters such as eective temperature, gravity etc.
            This work is being carried out under the collaboration of astronomers from India, South Africa
            and Belgium.</p><br>
            <h2>Intra-night Variability of Blazars</h2><br>

            <p>Rapid light variations are seen in many Quasars and almost in all the Blazars. The amount of vari-
            ability in dierent classes of active galactic nuclei has been studied extensively but many questions
            remain unanswered. To characterize the intra-night optical variability(INOV) of TeV Blazars and
            Quasars, we monitored a well dened sets of objects in optical bands. These observations play an
            important role in understanding the link between the dominant varieties of powerful active galactic
            nucleus and comparison of the characteristics of the two major sub-classes of TeV Blazars. The
            physical processes responsible for producing INOV of Blazars continue to be debated. For simulta-
            neous measurements on intra-night variability on dierent time-scale we used various Indian optical
            telescopes for photometry and the KANATA telescope of Japan for imaging polarimetry. Besides the
            quiescent slowly varying emission, the Blazars display 
            ares on time scales as short as minutes, we
            have assumed a two component model responsible for producing a long term and short term 
            aring
            trends.
            This work is being carried out in the collaborations among the astronomers from India, Japan and
            Poland.
